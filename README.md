Motivation
I made this project because I am currently doing the Odin Project and they had me make a website (using HTML) about a food of my choosing and I chose ice cream and thought since I like ice-cold summer treats making a website about popsicles sounded like a fun idea.

Challenges and Learning
I learned how to structure a website by using HTML and styling it with CSS. I struggled with making my image appear, but I solved it by dragging my image in the code editor.
